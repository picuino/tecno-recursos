<p>An <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">operating system</a>, also called an OS, is a <strong>set of programs</strong> that make a computer work. It is an intermediary that manages the hardware of a computer to serve the rest of the application programs that run on it.</p>
<p>The operating system is in charge of <strong>managing the resources</strong> of the computer, such as the processor, memory, and input and output devices, so that other programs can use them in an efficient and coordinated manner.</p>
<p>For example, the operating system is in charge of giving an empty block of memory to each program as they are being executed. It makes sure that each program has enough space in RAM and does not overlap with the others. The operating system also makes sure that the processor is distributed among all the programs every so often, giving the impression that they are all running at the same time. When multiple programs send multiple pages to print to a single printer, the operating system takes care of sending the pages in order so they don't get mixed up and an error doesn't occur. The operating system performs a similar management when several programs want to write to permanent memory at the same time.</p>
<p>The operating system also provides a <strong>user interface</strong> so that users can interact with the computer and perform different tasks at the same time, such as browsing the Internet, writing documents, playing music and videos, among other things.</p>
<p>If the operating system did not exist, each of the applications would have to include its own interface, its own printer manager, its own memory manager and agree with all the other programs to share the resources of the same computer in an orderly manner. .</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Components of an Operating System</a><a class="headerlink" href="#componentes-de-un-sistema-operativo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system#Components" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">components of an operating system</a> have the task of making the different parts of a computer work together.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Kernel</dt><dd>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">core</a> of an operating system is in charge of coordinating all the resources of the computer, both the elements both hardware and software programs. It is responsible for transmitting information between all these elements of the computer in an organized way to coordinate them with each other.</dd>
<dt>Device drivers</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">device drivers</a> act as intermediaries between user applications and different computer peripherals such as graphics cards, external memories, printers, web cameras, etc. .</p>
<p>When we install a printer driver, all application programs of that operating system will be able to print to that printer. Early operating systems, such as MS-DOS, did not have device drivers for printers, so each application program had to add its own driver for all printers on the market. The operating system with device drivers saves resources and makes it easy to program applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Process management</dt><dd>The process management system is responsible for distributing the microprocessor time among the different programs that are running. Thanks to this manager we can have, for example, 20 programs running on the computer at the same time and it will give the impression that they are all running at the same time, even though there is only one CPU core serving all of them.</dd>
<dt>Memory management</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">memory management system</a> is responsible for reserving blocks of RAM for programs when they are going to start executing or when they need space to open a new data file.</p>
<p>Another function of the memory manager is to perform garbage collection. This is the name given to the task that consists of freeing from memory the blocks that are no longer being used, to make room for new programs that the user wants to execute.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Graphical user interface</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">graphical user interface</a> , also called GUI, also called GUI, is an operating system program in charge of displaying information on the screen and collecting the actions that the user performs with the mouse, keyboard or touch screen.</p>
<p>This system is common to all the programs, thus achieving a homogeneous aspect for all the applications of the same operating system and simplifies the programming of the applications because they do not have to take care of representing the windows, the buttons, the scroll bar, menus and other graphic elements.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Outage Management</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interrupts</a> are signals that the peripherals send to the computer so that they are attended by it. When a computer user types a key on the keyboard, the character immediately appears on the screen. Similarly, when a user moves the mouse, the cursor immediately moves across the screen. Each keystroke and mouse movement generates an interrupt that alerts the computer to attend to the data the peripheral is sending.</p>
<p>Thanks to the interruptions, the computer does not have to be continually attending to each peripheral to check if they already have data ready to send.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File System</dt><dd><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">file system</a> is a system that controls how data is stored and retrieved from storage units such as CD-ROMs, USB sticks or hard drives. Without a file system, data stored on a storage medium would become a collection of information with no way to tell where one piece of data ends and the next begins.</p>
<p>Its main functions are allocating space to files, managing free space and access to saved data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Security system</dt><dd>It is the system in charge of controlling the access of programs or users to system resources. This system is in charge of tasks such as checking the correct username and password to enter a system session or to install programs.</dd>
<dt>Communications</dt><dd>The communications management system is responsible for controlling the data networks connected to the computer. It is in charge of managing the data packets that are sent over the local wired network, the Wi-Fi network or other data networks such as Bluetooth.</dd>
<dt>System programs</dt><dd>They are applications that are used to manage the operating system or to find out about its status. Examples of system programs are file explorer, control panel, command console, settings app in Android, etc.</dd>

It is also found in a multitude of embedded devices such as game consoles, routers, smart TVs, etc. It is also found in the core of the Android operating system.</p>
<p>The GNU/Linux operating system is based on the old <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unix</a> operating system.</p>
<p>Its main characteristics are the following.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>User interface</dt><dd><p>GNU/Linux has many graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Some are very simple, geared towards low memory devices (XFCE), some are similar to the Windows interface (KDE) and some are similar to the Apple GUI (Gnome).</p>
<p>A graphical interface that is commonly used in many embedded devices is a web page from which device parameters are controlled. It is a very fast and light interface. An example can be seen when connecting with a browser to the Internet router.</p>
<p>GNU/Linux can also be run without a graphical interface, by command line, which is very useful for professionals and so that the system occupies very little memory on the device.</p>
<p>GNU/Linux is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_software" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multiuser</a> operating system, so a single computer can serve several terminals at the same time, with different users connected to them.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Software compatibility</dt><dd><p>The GNU/Linux system has a multitude of applications from all fields and is aimed at developers.</p>
<p>In some cases there is a lack of compatibility with very popular programs, which can be run with the Windows emulation program &quot;Wine&quot;.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ease of customization</dt><dd><p>Being an open source and community controlled operating system, it is highly customizable. There are many free distributions aimed at all kinds of fields.</p>
<p>Its great ease of customization and its great security against malware is what makes this operating system so attractive to install it on web servers and all kinds of professional computers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hardware support</dt><dd>Since GNU/Linux is open software, some hardware developers such as Nvidia have made it difficult to make drivers for their products. Today most devices are supported in the operating system, which is compatible with a wide variety of hardware.</dd>

<p>The macOS operating system is based on the old <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unix</a> operating system as well as GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>Its main characteristics are the following.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>User interface</dt><dd><p>It is more minimalist and elegant than the graphical interface of Windows. The menu bar is always at the top of the screen, instead of in each application window.</p>
<p>macOS has full gesture support on the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touchpad</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Software compatibility</dt><dd><p>macOS has a smaller range of software available due to its lower market share and popularity. However, macOS remains a platform with an active developer base and a wide range of quality software available, especially for media editing and design applications.</p>
<p>macOS is much more resistant to malware attacks than Windows. Among other reasons, because fewer malicious programs are designed for this operating system, as it is less popular, and because it has a design that better prevents attacks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ease of customization</dt><dd>Although macOS has some customization possibilities, these are more limited compared to those offered by Windows or Linux.</dd>
<dt>Hardware support</dt><dd><p>macOS is designed to work exclusively on Apple devices, such as MacBooks, iMacs, and Mac Pros. This means that macOS is highly optimized for these devices, is more efficient and has better stability, but it is not compatible with other manufacturers.</p>
<p>As for peripherals, macOS has a smaller variety of compatible devices and in most cases the drivers are provided by Apple.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Price</dt><dd>The macOS operating system comes pre-installed for free on all Apple devices. The development of the operating system is financed with the cost of the hardware since it is an exclusive system for Apple products.</dd>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>User interface</dt><dd>Although it is similar to the Android interface, it tends to be more uniform and consistent across all Apple devices, whereas the Android interface can vary by manufacturer.</dd>
<dt>Software compatibility</dt><dd><p>Apple's App Store tends to be stricter with the quality and control of applications. As a result, software availability is less on the iOS operating system, although most popular apps are found without issue.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the less diversity of hardware in Apple devices makes the applications more robust and more optimized.</p>
<p>iOS devices typically have much longer operating system updates, up to 6 years, compared to Android devices, which hardly have any operating system updates for a period of 2 years from device launch.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ease of customization</dt><dd>The iOS system offers fewer options and less flexibility in customization than the competing Android system.</dd>
<dt>Hardware support</dt><dd>iOS is only compatible with Apple devices. This greatly restricts its use to a single manufacturer. As an advantage, having a more controlled hardware ecosystem makes it easier to optimize applications.</dd>
<dt>Price</dt><dd>iOS comes pre-installed by default on Apple mobile devices and is priceless. On the other hand, the financing of its development is done with the high price of Apple devices compared to the devices of the competition.</dd>
